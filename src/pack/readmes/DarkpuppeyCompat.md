Darkpuppey's Modded Overhauls - 1.16.5 Compatibility Patch
==========================================================

This is a simple compatibility patch for [Darkpuppey's Modded Overhauls](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/darkpuppeys-modded-overhauls) to make them work on 1.16.x Draconic Evolution the best I can.

ProjectE is not included as I use a different texture pack for it.

It changes the models instead of copying the textures to avoid duplicating All Rights Reserved content -- Draconic Evolution is under a broadly open source license.
