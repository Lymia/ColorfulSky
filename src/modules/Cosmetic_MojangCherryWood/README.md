Replaces BYG Cherry textures with the 1.20 ones. Also renames Cherry to Sakura, to disambiguiate between Croptopia's cherry fruit trees and BYG's cherry flower trees.

Textures from the following sources:
- Minecraft 1.20
- [Variant Bookshelves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/variant-bookshelves-fabric) (1.20 version)
- [Variant Crafting Tables](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/variant-crafting-tables) (1.20 version)
