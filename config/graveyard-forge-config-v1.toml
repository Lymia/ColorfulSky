#Welcome to The Graveyard Config!
#
#Here, you can disable structures to spawn, change their chance of spawning, change their separation and also change their salt.
#Additionally, you can turn the graveyard fog particles on and set the chance of spawning them (higher numbers = lower chance of spawning).
#Graveyard fog particles spawn from graveyard moss and add an atmospheric and spooky element while exploring.
#
#To disable a structure to spawn, simply go to the corresponding structure and change true to false.
#
#The Graveyard uses the vanilla structure spawning system. That is -
#- Separation is the minimum chunks between structures
#- Spacing is the average chunks between structures (Spacing value needs to be higher than Separation value!)
#- Salt is a special field that gives structures unique spawning positions. (Only change if you know what you are doing!)
#
#Notice: reducing the generation settings will increase the risk of structures overlapping. Especially jigsaw structures are unpredictable!
