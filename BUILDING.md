This repository is designed to be used with the instance folder. I use GDLauncher, but Twitch App should work just as well. To prepare this for use:

1. Install the needed Python modules with `pip3 install cursepy markdown toml`.
2. Run the `src/dist.py` Python script to get an updated `.zip` for the modpack, and import it into the launcher of your choice.
3. Copy the `mods` and `resourcepacks` folders into the repository.
4. Register the source repository as an instance in your launcher of choice.

To update the autogenerated configurations from source files, run `src/build.py`.
To create a fully built binary for Colorful Skies, run `src/dist.py`.
